# Content Marketing from Shipments

This rule helps generate content suggestions based on recent code changes, commits, and shipped features.

## Process

1. **Analyze Recent Changes**
   - Look at git log for the past week: `git log --since="1 week ago" --pretty=format:"%h - %s (%an, %ar)"`
   - Check merged PRs and their descriptions
   - Review modified files and their purpose
   - Identify new features, bug fixes, improvements, and refactors

2. **Categorize Changes by Impact**
   - **High Impact**: New features, major improvements, breaking changes
   - **Medium Impact**: Enhancements, notable bug fixes, performance improvements
   - **Low Impact**: Minor fixes, refactors, dependency updates

3. **Content Suggestions by Type**
