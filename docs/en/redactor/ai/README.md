## Exclusion of liability

The AI tools in WebJET CMS are designed to be useful assistants that speed up content creation and editing. However, always remember: AI outputs may contain errors, inaccuracies, or inappropriate content. Therefore, it is imperative that every user always check and verify the results before publishing them.

Further, as the creators of WebJET CMS, we disclaim responsibility for any problems caused by changes in the APIs of AI service providers such as OpenAI. Developments in AI are extremely dynamic - what works today may be unavailable or changed half a year from now. To avoid problems, we recommend that you regularly update WebJET CMS to the latest versions, where we will promptly reflect these changes and ensure compatibility.

The instructions provided for AI assistants are sample, changing models and API providers can change the response and its format and may not always be handled correctly. We recommend to modify the instructions according to your requirements and usage pattern. The number of tokens and therefore the cost of the response depends on the model used, you can optimize the assistant by changing the model and modifying the instructions. For example, you can change the model `gpt-5` to lower `gpt-5-mini` and the like.
