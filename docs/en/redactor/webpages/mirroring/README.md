# Mirroring

Section **Mirroring** offers an overview of linked folders and pages after actions [Mirror structures](../../apps/docmirroring/README.md). In addition to an overview of existing bindings, it also offers warnings of potentially erroneous bindings as well as the possibility to edit them.

The section consists of 3 cards:
- [Folders](groups.md) - overview of linked page folders
- [Website](docs.md) - overview of linked pages
- [Configuration](settings.md) - overview of mirroring configuration variables
