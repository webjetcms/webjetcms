# Campaigns

The bulk email app allows you to send bulk **personalised** email messages to multiple users. Each message is sent separately, individual recipients do not see the email addresses of other recipients.

The advantage is that each email can be personalised - if you put a tag in the body of the email `!name!` the recipient's real name is inserted instead.

Email can be sent to visitors who are registered in the admin part of the Web JET system, or create a file with a list of names and email addresses and then import them as email recipients.

## Basic

When creating a new record, we have in the tab **Basic** to choose only one card with the basic information we need to fill in, namely **Subject** a **Web page**.

**Subject** is automatically filled in after selecting **Web page with email text**. The name of the web page will be preset in the subject, which you can of course change. If you change the value **Web page with email text** a **Subject** already contains a value, you will be prompted by a notification if you wish to change the current object for a new one.

![](subject_confirm.png)

The sender details will be filled in automatically according to the logged-in user, but you can of course change them. If you want to use other values as default, you can use configuration variables `dmailDefaultSenderName` a `dmailDefaultSenderEmail`.

The text of the email is taken from the selected web page (including its design). We recommend creating a folder in the Web pages section, e.g. `Newsletter` with the appropriate template set. In this folder, first create a web page with the text of the email and then select it in the campaign.

![](editor.png)

You can insert the following tags in the text of the web page to insert user data:
- `!RECIPIENT_NAME!` - name and surname of the recipient
- `!RECIPIENT_EMAIL!` - email address of the recipient
- `!EMAIL_ID!` - unique email ID

If the recipient is from the WebJET CMS user database it is also possible to use other tags of the registered user:
- `!LOGGED_USER_NAME!` - first and last name (if conf. variable `fullNameIncludeTitle` set to true includes the title)
- `!LOGGED_USER_FIRSTNAME!` - name
- `!LOGGED_USER_LASTNAME!` - surname
- `!LOGGED_USER_TITLE!` - title
- `!LOGGED_USER_LOGIN!` - login name
- `!LOGGED_USER_EMAIL!` - email address
- `!LOGGED_USER_COMPANY!` - firm
- `!LOGGED_USER_CITY!` - city
- `!LOGGED_USER_ADDRESS!` - address (street)
- `!LOGGED_USER_COUNTRY!` - state
- `!LOGGED_USER_PHONE!` - telephone
- `!LOGGED_USER_ZIP!` - POSTCODE
- `!LOGGED_USER_ID!` - User ID
- `!LOGGED_USER_BIRTH_DATE!` - date of birth
- `!LOGGED_USER_FIELDA!` - free field A
- `!LOGGED_USER_FIELDB!` - free field B
- `!LOGGED_USER_FIELDC!` - free field C
- `!LOGGED_USER_FIELDD!` - free field D
- `!LOGGED_USER_FIELDE!` - free field E
- `!LOGGED_USER_GROUPS!` - list of user groups

## Advanced

In the charts **Advanced** you can set the email message fields for reply, copy and hidden copy.

If you enter a date in the start date field, the emails will start sending after the specified time (so you can schedule your email campaign in advance).

You can attach up to 3 attachments (files) to your email.

## Beneficiaries

In the charts **Beneficiaries** we can see an overview of all recipients who will receive the campaign emails. Recipients can be added, edited, duplicated or deleted in the table. When the campaign is saved, the real list of recipients and already sent emails from the database table is added `emails`

![](receivers.png)

!>**Warning,** the list of recipients is treated against certain non-conforming values:
- Duplication protection, checking for duplication in the entered emails as well as with those already existing in the campaign
- protection against inappropriate email, the email must comply with the standard format **meno@domena.sk** (special exception for [Import from xlsx](#import-from-xlsx))
- protection against unsubscribed emails, it is not possible to add a recipient whose email address is in the list [Unsubscribed emails](../unsubscribed/README.md)

!>**Warning,** if you change the recipient list AFTER the emails are sent, the resulting statistics will not be correct and may give the impression of a sending problem.

### Email status

Important is the "Email Status" column which can contain values:
- New - newly added email, you need to save the campaign to add this email to the campaign.
- Saved - the email is saved, waiting in the queue to be sent
- Sent - the email is sent, the exact date and time the email was sent is stored in the Send Date column
- Stopped - the email is ready to send, select the campaign in the campaign list table and click the button **Start sending** to send an email.
- Sending error - the number of attempts to send an email was exceeded (default 3 attempts). Either the email is incorrect or there is another error in the campaign.

### Manual addition

To manually add emails to your campaign, click on the "Add" button. Required is the "Email" field, in which you must enter one or more emails separated by **comma, semicolon, space or newline**. You can use multiple types of compartments at the same time, such as. `test1@test.sk, test2@test.sk; test3@test.sk  test4@test.sk`. The entered emails will then be added to the recipients of the campaign.

Field **Name** is optional. If you do not fill it in, the recipient's name will be retrieved from the user database based on an email match (if any). If there is no such email in the database, the value is inserted as the name `- -`. If the field **Name** you fill in, it will be set to all the emails you are currently entering via the field **E-mail**.

![](raw-import.png)

Manual addition offers the possibility **Skip erroneous entries**. If you enter E-mail as `Test1@test.sk, Test2@test.sk; Test13Wrong Test4@test.sk Test2@test.sk` and the option to Skip erroneous records **is switched off**, adding recipients stops at the first non-compliant value and an error is displayed:

![](recipients_editor_err.png)

The save ended on the third email `Test13Wrong` due to a value in the wrong format. The previous two emails were satisfactory and were saved (you can reload the data in the table to view it).

![](recipients_A.png)

**If the option is on**, the non-compliant values are skipped and a notification is displayed telling you which values were not saved and why:

![](recipients_notification.png)

Since only 3 of the 5 emails were matched, only 3 recipients were added to the campaign.

![](recipients_B.png)

### Adding from a group

To add emails to the campaign in bulk, use the button ![](users_from_group_button.png ":no-zoom"). Click to display a dialog box with the available user groups.

After selecting/ticking the desired group (or multiple groups), you must confirm your choice by pressing the ![](users_from_group_OK_button.png ":no-zoom"). If you do not want to save your change, you must close the dialog box.

![](users.png)

!>**Warning:** your changes **shall be saved immediately**. This means that you are not waiting for the campaign to be saved! Beware of this, as even if you don't save the edited campaign, the recipients added/removed by selecting the group will remain changed.

Your changes are immediately reflected in the tab **Beneficiaries**. Emails added from a group will always contain a value in the **Groups**. It can happen that there are emails among the recipients that belong to a group even if no group has been added to the campaign. The situation occurs if you manually add an email belonging to a group. WebJET will automatically recognize it and display it in the column **Group** all the groups under which it belongs.

![](receivers_B.png)

!>**Warning:** some emails may belong to more than one group. Only one of these groups needs to be added for the email to be added to the recipients. If an email belongs to 3 groups and you add them all, **no duplication of emails** as duplicate emails are not allowed.

### Import from xlsx

The bulk way to add/update recipients is via a standard import of recipients from an xlsx file.

![](xlsx-import.png)

In the file in the first line you need to have the following names defined:
- `Meno|recipientName` - name and surname of the recipient
- `E-mail|recipientEmail` - email address of the recipient

![](xlsx-import-example.png)

You can get the correct import file simply by exporting the recipients. You can then delete the ID column and fill in the names and email addresses for importing the recipients.

!>**Warning:**

- Importing from an xlxs file does not support adding multiple emails in one cell as in the case of manual addition. There must only ever be one email address in a cell.
- Importing from an xlxs file supports the email format exception. When manually adding, each mail must have the format **meno@domena.sk**. However, if you are copying emails from e.g. `Outlook`, the copied value can have the format `"JÃ¡n Tester <jan_tester@test.com>"`. If the value contains characters `<>`, **(in that exact order)**, the value in between shall be used. In this case, it would just be the value `jan_tester@test.com`. This value must have the format **meno@domena.sk**.

## Openings

In the charts **Openings** the opening of the email by the recipient is recorded. This is done by means of an embedded image. Not all recipients will confirm that the image has been retrieved from the server, so the list is not complete.

![](opens.png)

##

Card **Click** shows a list of clicks on a link in an email. A recipient can click on a link multiple times, so multiple clicks from a single recipient can be recorded in the table.
