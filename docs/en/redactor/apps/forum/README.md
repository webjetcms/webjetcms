# Forum/Discussion

The Forum/Discussion application, which allows you to insert a discussion into the page, has the following display options:
- Discussion forum - a simple discussion under the article.
- Discussion board - multi-topic discussion (`Message board`), where the discussion is divided into groups and sub-topics, which will contain individual contributions. Sub-topics can also be added by the user.

## Discussion board

"Discussion Board", also referred to as `Message board`, is a type of multi-topic discussion. It can be embedded as an application in the page. The discussion is divided into groups (sections) and sub-topics. For each sub-topic, the number of posts added, the number of views and the date the last post was added are recorded and displayed under the topic title.

So a visitor can create a new topic and then discussion posts are added to the topic. This creates a kind of tree structure of discussion posts.
