## Page analysis

When editing a page, you can embed the SEO application into the page. Technically, it is not inserted into the page, but it will display a keyword analysis of the currently displayed web page.

The application analyzes the readability of the text, uses the technique of analysis `Gunning fog index`. Estimates the number of years of education needed to understand the text. In practice:
- 6 means excellent legibility.
- 8 to 10 are magazine and newspaper articles, short stories, easy to read and understand.
- 11 to 14 are already reaching more specialist articles. Scientific papers usually reach the level of 15 to 20 and already require full concentration from the reader.
- Above 20, only texts where the writer completely ignores the reader.

The table shows the occurrence of the defined keywords in the text of the current web page. You can edit the list of keywords in the Keywords field (separate individual words/phrases with a comma) and click OK to refresh the table.
